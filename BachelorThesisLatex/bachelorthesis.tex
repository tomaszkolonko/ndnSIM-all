\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
On this page I would like to thank everybody who supported me to write this bachelor thesis.
First I would like to thank my coach Eirini Kalogeiton. She supported me trough the whole process of writing this thesis, spend many hours for pair programming sessions and gave valueable inputs when nothing seemed to work anymore.
After that I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Torsten Braun who allowed me to write this thesis in his research group. I am also very grateful for the resources that were generously provided by the reasearch group of Prof. Braun.

\begin{abstract}
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a new network approach where the focus lies on the names and not on the host identifiers. This new network approach comes with many benefits.
