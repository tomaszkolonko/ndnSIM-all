\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
On this page I would like to thank everybody who supported me to write this bachelor thesis.
First I would like to thank my coach Eirini Kalogeiton. She supported me trough the whole process of writing this thesis, spend many hours for pair programming sessions and gave valuable inputs when nothing seemed to work anymore.
After that I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Torsten Braun who allowed me to write this thesis in his research group. I am also very grateful for the resources that were generously provided by the research group of Prof. Braun.

\begin{abstract}

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a new network approach based on the information-centric networking paradigm (ICN), which tries to provide a more secure, flexible and scalable network. CCN does not operate on a host-to-host basis, but emphasizes the content itself by making it directly addressable and routable. Knowledge of the topology is therefore not required as the routing is based on the names of the content and happens only locally on the intermediate nodes. This allows much more efficient communication in highly mobile and dynamic environments, where no static topology is given, and devices enter and leave a given area very frequently.

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

In this thesis a new routing strategy for VANET's has been developed in ndnSIM version 2.0 within the ns-3 network simulator. The current implementation supports only routing based on incoming and outgoing faces. Since WiFi and other forms of wireless networking broadcast data by design, a new mechanism has been introduced for forwarding and discriminating by MAC addresses. Two new fields have been added to the interest and data packages for original and target MAC addresses. FIB tables were extended with the new MAC address fields in order to forward the interests to the correct upstream nodes. PIT tables were also extended so that the data could follow the interests way back to the requesting consumer. A new strategy has been implemented for flooding the interest if the FIB entries have not yet been populated with known MAC addresses and to forward specifically hop by hop if the FIB entries showed actual intermediate target nodes with lower costs.

The scenario was implemented in ndnSIM and evaluated using the ns-3 network simulator. Two distinct simulations were conducted and compared to the default forwarding strategy of ndnSIM as of version 2.0. The static scenario with 8 nodes floods the network to get information about the current topology and uses this information to route further interests by unicast towards the content source. A much lower and constant latency was achieved while increasing the satisfaction ratio (satisfied interests / interests send out). The amount of received data was more than tripled while the retransmission rate was kept slightly lower than the default. The second scenario with 16 nodes also outperformed the default implementation on all observed metrics. The performance on the mobile scenario has been roughly doubled on all metrics.
