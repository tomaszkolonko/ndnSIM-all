\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
On this page I would like to thank everybody who supported me to write this bachelor thesis.
First I would like to thank my coach Eirini Kalogeiton. She supported me trough the whole process of writing this thesis, spend many hours for pair programming sessions and gave valuable inputs when nothing seemed to work anymore.
After that I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Torsten Braun who allowed me to write this thesis in his research group. I am also very grateful for the resources that were generously provided by the research group of Prof. Braun.

\begin{abstract}
Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a new network approach based on the information-centric networking paradigm (ICN), which tries to provide a more secure, flexible and scalable network. CCN does not operate on a host-to-host basis but emphasizes the content itself by making it directly addressable and routable. Knowledge of the topology is therefore not required as the routing is based on the names of the content and happens only locally on the intermediate nodes. This allows much more efficient communication in highly mobile and dynamic environments, where no static topology is given, and devices enter and leave a given area very frequently.

In this thesis a new routing strategy for VANET's has been developed in ndnSIM version 2.0 within the ns-3 network simulator. The current implementation supports only routing based on incoming and outgoing faces. Since Wifi and other forms of wireless networking broadcast data by design, a new mechanism has been introduced for forwarding and discriminating by mac addresses. Two new fields have been added to the interest and data packages for original and target mac addresses. FIB tables were extended with the new mac address fields in order to forward the interests to the correct upstream nodes. PIT tables were also extended so that the data could follow the interests way back to the requesting consumer. A new strategy has been implemented for flooding the interest if the FIB entries have not yet been populated with known mac addresses and to forward specifically hop by hop if the FIB entries showed actual intermediate target nodes with lower costs. (TODO: add some info about the multiple netDevices when done)

The scenario was implemented and evaluated using the ns-3 network simulator. Simulation with 100 nodes were conducted for 21 times and ...... (TODO: finish this part as soon as you have some results)

(TODO: CHANGE WORDING from Amadeo14 BEGIN) -> Performance evaluation is carried by means of ndnSIM, the official NDN simulator, that is overhauled for use in realistic wireless ad-hoc environments. Results collected under variable traffic loads and topologies provide insights into the behaviors of both forwarding approaches and help to derive a set of recommendations that are crucial to the successful design of a forwarding strategy for named data ad-hoc wireless networking <- (TODO: CHANGE WORDING from Amadeo14 END)
